# Home-Automation-System
### Designing and implementing a smart home automation system using Cisco Packet Tracer focusing on making the network a secure one and accessing the appliances through a smartphone.

A smart home is one that features a system that links to your appliances to automate particular chores and is often operated from a distance. Sprinklers, cameras, and home security systems may all be programmed using a smart home system, along with other devices like air conditioners and heaters and refrigerators. You can manage and automate the numerous electrical and technologically based home appliances and equipment with a smart home automation system. Additionally, you may manage everything by using software that is loaded on your smartphone or other mobile device, which will make your life much simpler. You can always check on the 
status of your remotely controlled home devices, even if you are at work or the grocery store.

### Conclusion: 

The Smart Home Automation system using Cisco Packet Tracer resulted in automation of most of the appliances used in home and also it has an eco friendly design and also connects with our phone device ensuring we can easily operate it from anywhere in the world. This system also helps to secure our home. The remote server helps in making it more secure and easy to access for the owner at the same time. The IOT devices are tried to keep minimal but can vary on the layout of the house. The IOT devices used are smart devices and hence while implementing the project in real life should be noted.
